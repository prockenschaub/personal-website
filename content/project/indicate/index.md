INDICATE is a pioneering EU-funded initiative to enable secure data sharing between intensive care units across Europe.

ICUs operate in data-rich environments, but fragmented datasets and the lack of standardised cross-border infrastructure limit what we can learn from this data. INDICATE addresses this by building a federated infrastructure that allows researchers to run analyses across multiple sites without moving sensitive patient data.

The consortium brings together partners from across Europe to develop secure, privacy-preserving methods for large-scale ICU data analysis — enabling more inclusive AI models and better evidence for clinical decision-making.
